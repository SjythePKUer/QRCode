# QRCode decoder

Visual Studio 2015(v140) + OpenCV3.1.0 + msvcp120d.dll + mscvr120d.dll

I have finished the three big symbols' detection. 
Next step is to get the total 12 corner points from the three contours, 
and then confirm the three symbols belong to ONE QRCode by detection of another symbol (I don't know how to describe it in English)
